## Data for CA-2

In this repo you will find two scripts you can use to set up data for CA-2. The first one, _zipScript.sql_ you must use (unless you find a similar/better script). The second  (_hobbyScript.sql_) you can use if you like.

### Script for zip-codes

For an entity class defined as below:
```java
@Entity
public class CityInfo implements Serializable {
    private static final long serialVersionUID = 1L;
    @Id
    @Column(length = 4)
    private String zipCode;
    @Column(length=35)
    private String city;
    ...
``` 
You can set up all Danish zip-codes using the script-file _zipScript.sql_

Either run the script your usual way, up against your database, or let JPA execute the script by adding these two lines to (only) the persistence-unit "pu" in persistence.xml.
````
<property name="javax.persistence.sql-load-script-source" value="META-INF/zipScript.sql"/>
<property name="javax.persistence.schema-generation.database.action" value="drop-and-create"/>
````
Note: this requires you to place the script under META-INF, (next to persistence.xml)

__After having executed this script, you should never write to the `CityInfo-table`, only READ.__
_(This is NOT something you have to enforce on the database, just realize that, once initialized, all data is here,  and they wont change)_

### Script for Hobbies
A problem you probably will find with the Hobby table is how to ensure that we won't get the same hobby in many different versions (Fodbold, fodbold, f√•dbold,football, soccer etc.).
One way to ensure that, is to only allow Hobbies selected from a list of approved hobbies.

The (non-normalized) script _hobbyScript.sql_ is designed from a screen-scraped version of the data found on this [Wikipeda-page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_hobbies) and titles (name) are hereafter auto translated to danish (so be prepared for some "strange" hobbies)

You can use it if you set up your Hobby entity class to match the following:
```java
@Entity
public class Hobby implements Serializable {
    private static final long serialVersionUID = 1L;
    
    @Id
    @Column(length = 50)
    private String name;
    
    private String wikiLink;
    private String category;
    private String type;
    ...
```
Run the script, using one of the strategies given for zipScript.sql
